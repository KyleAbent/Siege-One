Specator Director

    When joining Spectate team, player is prompted with message to open menu and click on Director for some sweet camera angles.
    Spectator team only.
    Open menu, click director and click "DoDirect" to enable the camera angles. Click "DontDirect" to disable camera angles.
    Must be in free cam this version.
    Updates in combat target every 6 seconds, closest it can find to current position
    If can't find combat target, or if current target dies, find any closest player
    
    This is simple version just to get the functionality working.
    It can be tuned with more angles. With menu options to disable/enable settings, change intervals, whatever.
    For now this should help slightly with the idea of AFKING with great footage to watch in the meantime, maybe.
    
    
    Known Issue: 
        Camera angle might hang , not move close if way too far out of range. requiring to move forward until in range then it will move by itsrelf
        Getting out of the director mode is a hassle
